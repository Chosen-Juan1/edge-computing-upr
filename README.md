- **Project 2: Addressing Memory Consumption in Edge Devices through Data Quantization** (NSF Award OIA-1849243)
  - Description: In Puerto Rico, frequent natural disasters disrupt healthcare systems, making it essential to develop diagnostic tools that work without relying on central networks. Our project focuses on optimizing deep learning models by reducing their memory and computational demands, allowing them to run efficiently on portable devices. We aim to do this through quantization, essentially converting 32-bit data to 8-bit, significantly cutting memory usage.

    This approach will be applied to a biomedical case of anemia detection through conjunctiva pallor analysis. By using lightweight models, we hope to create effective, low-power diagnostic tools that can function in areas with limited infrastructure, improving healthcare access during emergencies.
